\section{Trigger Studies\label{app:trigger}}

Several different trigger strategies were considered to maximize effectiveness of the analysis. In Tab.~\ref{tab:trigopt}, we compare the significance for different signal masses for just HT800, the Boosted OR triggers (the triggers used by the boosted analysis), and the BTag OR triggers (the triggers used by the resolved analysis:HLTQuadJet45TripleBTagCSVp087v, HLTDoubleJet90Double30TripleBTagCSVp087v). The HT800 trigger can't be used by itself because it's prescaled in some of the runs, and the Boosted OR performs best at mid-mass, where this analysis is most effective, so this trigger set was chosen.

\end{table}

It was noticed that the triggers never became fully efficient as a function of reduced mass. When examining the same trigger efficiency as a function of HT, in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigHTeff}, it does become fully efficient around ~1000 \GeV as expected. In order to account for this, it is best to bin trigger efficiency in $|AK8 eta - (AK4_1 + AK4_2) eta|$, or $\Delta\eta$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:trigdEta}, we can see that for $\Delta\eta > 1.3$ the trigger is not fully efficient as a function of reduced mass, but for $\Delta\eta < 1.3$, it is. Binning in $\Delta\eta$ was optimized, as documented in~\ref{app:deta}, for 0-1.0 and 1.0-2.0.

The trigger combination has a high efficiency at reduced mass below 700 GeV, dips down between 700 and 1000 GeV, and is then fully efficient afterwards. In order to better understand why we see this high efficiency at low reduced mass, each trigger in the set was examined separately, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigsep}.

\begin{figure}[thb!]

All triggers but AK8PFJet360\_TrimMass30 and PFHT650\_WideJetMJJ900DEtaJJ1p5 show this phenomenon. Upon closer look at reduced mass for QCD with the preselection applied, with the preselection applied and PFJet260, and with the preselection applied + PFJet260 + Boosted OR (Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDredm}), we see that the difference between the latter two is almost nonexistent below 700 GeV. Comparing these to QCD with no trigger selection, we can see that PFJet260 isn't fully efficient. 

\begin{figure}[thb!]

\caption{Reduced mass for QCD after preselection, after preselection + PFJet260, and after preselection + PFJet260 + Boosted OR.}
\label{fig:QCDredm}
\end{figure}

Lower \pt triggers were examined in place of PFJet260 and it was found that efficiency at low reduced mass goes down as \pt threshold goes down, which supports the hypothesis that the high efficiency at low mass is because of the efficiency of the PFJet260 trigger. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:lowPTtrig}. A lower threshold trigger was not chosen, however, because of prescales that come with lower threshold triggers, and because the analysis is not sensible below 700 GeV.

\label{fig:lowPTtrig}
\end{figure}

We examined the realtionship between HT and reduced mass to better understand why we don't see high efficiency at low HT as we do with reduced mass. In Fig.~\ref{fig:2DHTredm}, we see that a large reason for this is that there are very few events with HT $<$ 700 GeV, which is expected because of the triggers that have been chosen. With few events in this region, we see low efficiency at low HT, whereas there are more events with reduced mass $<$ 700 GeV, so we are able to notice the high efficiency at low reduced mass due to the inefficiency of PFJet260.

Trigger efficiency was also examined as a function of b-tagging variables in data. It was found that, while the triggers are never fully efficient as a function of b-tagging, there is no dependency on b-tagging variables, Fig.~\ref{fig:btagEff}.

\label{fig:btagEff}
\end{figure}

To ensure that full efficiency is reached for b-tagging variables, we examined double b-tagger with the same trigger preselection but raising the reduced mass requirement to $>$ 1200 GeV. It was found that in both data (Runs B-H, B-F, and G-H) as well as MC, the OR of triggers was fully efficient, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:doubleb1200}.

\end{figure}

To ensure that the flavour of QCD used in the trigger efficiency calculation matches signal, since we are using a trigger with a b-tag, we examined several different selections to find the one with the most b-flavoured jets. We looked at a trigger preselection as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item At least one AK8 jet in the event with $\pt > 300\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$;
 \item At least two AK4 jets with $\pt > 30\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$, with a deep CSV value $>$ 0.2219;
 \item Out of the AK8 and AK4 jets that satisfy the above requirements, one AK8 jet and two AK4 jets are chosen to be the three signal jets. The highest $\pt$ AK8 jet with $M_{\rm soft\,drop} > 40$ \GeV that is $\Delta R$ $>$ 0.8 away from two AK4 jets that are within $\Delta R$ $<$ 1.5 of each other is chosen. If there are more than two AK4 jets that satisfy this criteria, the two AK4 jets with the highest deepCSV value are chosen.
 \item The soft drop mass of the AK8 jet is $105 < M_{\rm soft\,drop} < 135\GeV$, with all necessary jet mass corrections applied;
 \item The combined mass of the two AK4 jet is $90 < M_{dijet} < 140\GeV$;
% \item The AK8 jet is $\Delta R$ $>$ 0.8 away from each AK4 jet, and the two AK4 jets are within $\Delta R$ $<$ 1.5,
 %      and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with highest $\pt$ AK8 jet and then the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen;
 \item Reduced mass, introduced in Eqn.~\ref{eq:Mjjs}, $>$ 700 GeV, since the analysis has little sensitivity below this value;
 \item $\Delta\eta$ = $|AK8\eta - (AK4jet1 + AK4jet2)\eta| < 2.0$;
%and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with the |lowest M_{\rm soft\,drop} - 120| and the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen.
 \item Lepton veto.
\end{itemize}

The flavour of the two selected AK4 jets in background can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:flav1}. We also examined this selection with the medium AK4 deep CSV tag (0.6324), in Fig.~\ref{fig:flav2}. We also examined this selection with the medium AK4 deep CSV tag (0.6324) as well as the low double b-tag (0.3), in Fig.~\ref{fig:flav3}. Lastly, we look at full selection in Fig.~\ref{fig:flav4}. Looking at all of these, we see that we have the highest ratio of b-flavoured jets to other jets when we use the above selection with a medium AK4 deep CSV tag, so we implemented this in our trigger selection.

The percentage of events that pass only the b-tagging trigger at trigger preselection (with the low WP deep CSV tag) and at full selection was calculated for the various signal samples and data, found in Tab.~\ref{tab:btagonlytrig}.

\caption{Fraction of events that exclusively pass the btag trigger at the trigger preselection level and at the full selection level.}
\label{tab:btagonlytrig}
\end{table}

Signal MC is 100\% one $b\bar{b}$ jet and two additional b-jets, while QCD rarely has more than two b-jets per event. However, since our trigger only has one b-tag, it is sufficient to measure $b\bar{b}$ component of data. Looking at events in the trigger preselection with at least one b, assuming that it is likely that there are two b-jets rather than one, we calculate that these make up approximately 85\% of the events, with 5\% coming from $t\bar{t}$ events and 10\% coming from any other process. Then to calculate the systematic error on the trigger efficiency calculation, we consider the following,
\begin{equation}
N_{all} = N_{bb} + N_{tt} + N_{other} = f_{bb}N_{all} + f_{tt}N_{all} + f_{other}N_{all},
\end{equation}
where $N_{all}$ is the total number of events, $N_{bb}$ is the number of $b\bar{b}$ events, $N_{tt}$ is the number of $t\bar{t}$ events, $N_{other}$ represents all other events, $f_{bb}$ represents the fraction of events that are $b\bar{b}$ (85\%), $f_{tt}$ represents the fraction of events that are $t\bar{t}$ events (5\%), and $f_{other}$ represents the fraction of other events (10\%). Then for $N_{pass}$, the total number of events that pass the trigger selection, we have
\begin{equation}
N_{pass} = \epsilon_{bb}f_{bb}N_{all} + \epsilon_{tt}f_{tt}N_{all} + \epsilon_{other}f_{other}N_{all},
\end{equation}
 where $\epsilon_{bb}$ is the efficiency for $b\bar{b}$ events passing only the b-tag trigger, $\epsilon_{tt}$ is the efficiency for $t\bar{t}$ passing only the b-tag trigger, and $\epsilon_{other}$ is the efficiency for other events passing only the b-tag trigger. We can rewrite this as
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{N_{pass}}{N_{all}} = \epsilon_{tot} = \epsilon_{bb}f_{bb} + \epsilon_{tt}f_{tt} + \epsilon_{other}f_{other},
 \end{equation}
 which can be solved for $\epsilon_{bb}$ to give us
 \begin{equation}
 \epsilon_{bb} = \frac{\epsilon_{tot}}{f_{bb}} - \epsilon_{tt}\frac{f_{tt}}{f_{bb}} - \epsilon_{other}\frac{f_{other}}{f_{bb}}.
 \end{equation}tot
Since $t\bar{t}$ is well studied, we consider that our systematic error arises from the third term in the equation above. Then making the conservative assumption that $\epsilon_{other}$ can vary from 0 to 1, we calculate that $\Delta\epsilon_{bb}$ is equivalent to $(1 - 0)\frac{f_{other}}{f_{bb}}$, or 0.1/0.85 $\sim$ 0.12. However, the b-tag trigger is one of many grouped together in an OR. For data, only 5\% of the events pass only the b-tag trigger in the OR. Therefore, our total systematic uncertainty is $(0.12)( 0.05) \sim 0.006$. This is extremely small compared to any error reported on the scale factor as documented in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigSF}, where errors bars range from 0.1 to 1.2 in total.
