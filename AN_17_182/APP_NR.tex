\section{Non Resonant Analysis\label{app:NR}}

The same analysis can be performed on non-resonant signal samples. Signal samples consist of various diHiggs processes, including an SM sample, a box diagram sample, and 12 BSM samples. Further description of these can be found in~\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-17-017}, the resolved HH to 4b non resonant analysis. This can also be combined with the boosted analysis (B2G-16-026) approach to produce a boosted non resonant analysis.
