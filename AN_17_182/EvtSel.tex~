\section{Event reconstruction and selection\label{sec:EvtSel}}

\subsection{Trigger and event cleaning\label{ss:trigger}}

The same dataset, triggers, and trigger efficiency calculations used for the boosted analysis ~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026} are used in this analysis. The trigger algorithms used in this analysis place requirements on the scalar sum of jet transverse energy, \HT, jet \pt, the jet groomed mass, or \PQb-tagging. The trigger paths used are listed in Table~\ref{tab:trigpaths}. The L1 $\HT$ trigger paths in the later run periods were observed to have an inefficiency that is recovered using the jet $\pt$ based triggers. The \texttt{HLT\_PFHT800} trigger was prescaled in Run2016H and hence the path \texttt{HLT\_PFHT900} was added to compensate for this.

The trigger requirement is applied to both the data and the MC (signal and \ttbar). In order to compensate for the difference in trigger response between the data and the simulation, trigger efficiency scale factors, defined as the ratio of the trigger efficiency as measured in the data to that in the MC, are applied to the simulated events. A baseline trigger of \textsc{HLT\_PFJet260} is used to select events for the measurement of the trigger efficiency. This trigger is prescaled over much of the run period, yet provides enough events for measurement of the efficiencies and the scale factors. Events passing the baseline trigger are further required to pass selection criteria close to the signal selection in the actual analysis:
\begin{itemize}
 \item At least one AK8 jet in the event with $\pt > 250\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$;
 \item The soft drop mass of the AK8 jet is $105 < M_{\rm soft\,drop} < 135\GeV$, with all necessary jet mass corrections applied;
 \item At least two AK4 jets with $\pt > 30\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$, with a deep CSV value $>$ 0.2219;
 \item The combined mass of the two AK4 jet is $105 < M_{dijet} < 135\GeV$;
 \item The AK8 jet is $\Delta R$ $>$ 0.8 away from each AK4 jet, and the two AK4 jets are within $\Delta R$ $<$ 1.5,
       and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with highest $\pt$ AK8 jet and then the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen;
%and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with the |lowest M_{\rm soft\,drop} - 120| and the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen.
 \item Lepton veto.
\end{itemize}
The details of these variables and selections are later described in Secs.~\ref{ss:JetSel},~\ref{ss:EvtSelMass}, and~\ref{ss:HTag}. A study on how the AK8 + two AK4 triplet is chosen based off of $\pt$, mass, and b-tag can be found in Sec.~\ref{app:AK8AK4choice}.

Trigger efficiency is measured as a function of the ``reduced mass'' introduced in Eqn.~\ref{eq:Mjjs} of Section~\ref{sss:DijetMassDef}. The efficiency is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigeEffvsMjj_JetHT_DetaBins}. Trigger efficiency was also examined in $H_{T}$, and efficiency as a function of $\Delta\eta$ between the two AK4 jets and the AK8 jet is examined; both studies can be found in Sec.~\ref{app:trigger}, along with a study of how the trigger paths were chosen.
%The $\Delta\eta_{jj}$ variable if quite different for the signal and the background, and hence the efficiency is measured in three $\Delta\eta_{jj}$ regions: 0.0--0.434, 0.434--0.868, and 0.868--1.3. The efficiencies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigeEffvsMjj_JetHT_DetaBins}.

%The combined set of triggers reaches full efficiciency for $\mjjs > 1000\GeV$. %over all the $\Delta\eta_{jj}$ ranges. For $\mjjs < 1000\GeV$, the trigger efficiencies are higher for smaller $\Delta\eta_{jj}$, where most of the signal lie, and are smaller at larger values of $\Delta\eta_{jj}$. Furthermore, the data/MC scale factor too varies depending on $\Delta\eta_{jj}$. 
%Since we begin the search from $\mjjs$ well below 1000\GeV, o
One needs to be especially careful of the modelling of the trigger efficiency turn-on curves in the data and the simulations. Since the baseline trigger \textsc{HLT\_PFJet260} too has some inefficiency for low \mjjs, we measure it in the MC and assign an uncertainty to the trigger efficiency scale factor based on this.

Earlier the boosted analysis measured the trigger efficiency using an orthogonal trigger path \texttt{HLT\_Mu50} in bins of 20\GeV in the dijet mass distribution. {\bf However, this is no longer used, since our event selection vetoes events with isolated leptons, and hence this selection is completely orthogonal to our signal region.} The details of this study can be found in ~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026}. 
%The dijet mass distribution used to derive the efficiency using this old strategy in data can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mjj_trigeEffvsMjj_SingleMu} (upperleft) and the trigger efficiency measured in data can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mjj_trigeEffvsMjj_SingleMu} (top right). An efficiency of $> 99\%$ is reached for dijet mass above 1.1\TeV. The efficiency turn-on curves for the Run periods B--H individually are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Mjj_trigeEffvsMjj_SingleMu_RunPeriods} of Appendix~\ref{app:TrigEffs}. The same figure also shows the trigger turn-on as a function of $\mjjs \equiv \mjj - (\mj^{1}-\mH) - (\mj^{2}-\mH)$, defined in Section~\ref{sss:DijetMassDef}. This is the variable that we use for the search for a di-Higgs resonance.

%\textcolor{red}{Is this still true?}
After passing the trigger, events are required to have at least one reconstructed $\Pp\Pp$ collision vertex satisfying the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Vertex number of degrees of freedom $> 4$;
  \item Absolute displacement from the beamspot position along the $z$ direction $< 24$~\cm;
  \item Absolute displacement from the beamspot position along the transverse direction $< 2$~\cm.
\end{itemize}
Many additional vertices, corresponding to other overlapping $\Pp\Pp$ collisions (pileup), are usually reconstructed in an event using charged particle tracks. We assume that the primary interaction vertex (PV) corresponds to the one that maximizes the sum in $\pt^2$ and the magnitude of $\sum{\pt}$ from the associated physics objects. Events are vetoed if they contain one (with tight ID) or two (with loose ID) opposite-sign same-flavour isolated electrons or muons with $\pt$ in excess of 20 GeV. No veto on the presence of isolated photons is applied.

\subsection{Jet kinematics selection\label{ss:JetSel}}

Individual particles are reconstructed using a particle flow (PF) algorithm~\cite{PFPAS2009, CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001}, that combines the information from all the CMS detector components. Each such particle is referred to as a PF candidate. The five classes of PF candidates are  muons, electrons, photons, charged hadrons, and neutral hadrons. 

The anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm~\cite{antiKtAlgorithm}, implemented in \textsc{FastJet}~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma}, clusters PF candidates~\cite{PFPAS2009, CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001} into jets using a distance parameter $R = 0.8$ (referred to as AK8 jets) and jets using a distance parameter $R = 0.4$ (referred to as AK4 jets). 
In order to mitigate the effect of pileup on jet observables, we take advantage of pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) ~\cite{puppi} for AK8 jets. This method uses local shape information, event pileup properties and tracking information together in order to compute a weight describing the degree to which a particle is pileup-like. No additional pileup corrections are applied to AK8 jets clustered from these weighted inputs.

The jet 4-momenta are corrected to account for the difference between the measured and the expected momentum at the particle level, using a standard CMS correction procedure described in Refs.~\cite{JINST6,CMS-DP-2013-011}. The \texttt{Summer16\_23Sep2016V4} jet energy corrections~\cite{JESUncertaintyTWiki} were used. All AK8 jets are further required to pass tight jet identification requirements~\cite{JetID13TeVTWiki} provided by the JetMET POG . These requirements are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tightjetid}.

Figs.~\ref{fig:AK8pteta},~\ref{fig:AK41pteta},~\ref{fig:AK42pteta} show the $\pt$ and $\eta$ of the three selected jets. A preselection is applied to QCD MC, \ttbar MC, and Bulk Graviton signal points for masses 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 GeV as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Passes trigger selection;
 \item At least one AK8 jet in the event with $\pt > 250\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$;
 \item The soft drop mass of the AK8 jet is $M_{\rm soft\,drop} > 40\GeV$, with all necessary jet mass corrections applied;
 \item At least two AK4 jets with $\pt > 30\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$, with a deep CSV value $>$ 0.2219; 
 \item The AK8 jet is $\Delta R$ $>$ 0.8 away from each AK4 jet, and the two AK4 jets are within $\Delta R$ $<$ 1.5,
       and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with the highest $\pt$ AK8 jet and then the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen;
%and if more than one AK8 + two AK4 triplet is found, the triplet with the |lowest M_{\rm soft\,drop} - 120| and the highest AK4 deep CSV values is chosen.
 \item Lepton veto;
 \item Fails selection of the fully boosted HH4b analysis~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026} and the selection of the fully resolved analysis (HIG-17-009), which is documented in Sec.~\ref{ss:boostres}.
\end{itemize}

All figures in this section have the same preselection, with QCD MC (yellow) and \ttbar (red) weighted by their cross section multiplied by the luminosity of the dataset and divided by the total number of events. The signal samples (different dashed lines) are weighted by 50 multiplied by the cross section multiplied by the luminosity of the dataset and divided by the total number of events, so that they are easy to see on the plots. The optimization of the $\pt$ cut is documented in Sec.~\ref{app:pt}, while the additional preselection cuts are used to choose a phase space similar to that of the signal region while remaining as general as possible to show the shape of each variable.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\PH}{H} mass selection\label{ss:EvtSelMass}}

The mass of the AK8 jet can be used to suppress the multijet and \ttbar backgrounds. Underlying event (UE) activity and pileup energy are first removed from the AK8 jet through the implementation of a jet-grooming algorithm called Soft Drop~\cite{jetpruning1,jetpruning2}. 

%The invariant mass $\mjj$ is calculated for the two leading jets. In Fig. the raw $\mjsd$ distribution of the two leading jets is shown for both simulated background and signal events. For jets initiated by a quark or a gluon, $\mjsd$ peaks around 15~\GeV, while jets from high-momentum $\PH$ boson decay usually have a soft-drop mass around 120~\GeV.  The difference of $\approx 5\GeV$ relative to the nominal $m_\PH$ value is related to the presence of neutrinos produced by the semileptonic decays of \PB~mesons, and the inherent nature of  the softdrop procedure \cite{CMS-AN-15-265}. A small peak near 15~\GeV is also observed for signal events, and corresponds mainly to asymmetric decays in which the softdrop algorithm removes the decay products of one of the two \PB~mesons.

A dedicated jet energy energy calibration is applied to the softdrop mass as derived in Ref.~\cite{CMS-AN-16-235}. The correction is derived in two steps. First, a weight to account for a $\pt$ dependent softdrop jet mass shift introduced at generator level (``gen correction'') is computed. Second, to account for any residual $\pt$ and $\eta$ dependence, an additional weight is calculated based on the difference between the reconstructed and the generated softdrop mass (``reco correction'') after the ``gen correction'' calculated previously has been applied. The difference in reconstructed and generated softdrop mass is a 5-10\% effect. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:AK8mass} shows the AK8 soft-drop corrected jet mass. The corrections applied to H-jets yield a mass stable with \pt and number of true interactions, peaking around the H mass. Distributions of AK8 uncorrected soft-drop jet mass and details relating to the uncorrected distributions can be found in ~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026}.

The combined mass of the two AK4 jets can also be used to suppress the multijet and \ttbar backgrounds as well, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:AK4dijetmass}.

The $M_{\rm soft\,drop}$ signal mass window is restricted to between 105 and 135 \GeV, to avoid overlapping with other analyses targeting W and Z resonances. The AK4 dijet mass window has the same window, where the optimization of this window is documented in Sec.~\ref{app:mass}.

\subsection{Identification of H candidates\label{ss:HTag}}

\subsubsection{N-subjettiness selection\label{sec:EvtSelNsubjettiness}}

The quantity N-subjettiness~\cite{Thaler:2010tr,Thaler:2011gf,Stewart:2010tn} $\tau_N$ is used to quantify the degree to which jet constituents can be arranged into N subjets. The ratio $\nsub = \tau_2/\tau_1$  is calculated for the two $\PH$ jets. Both the jets are required to have $\nsub < 0.55$. We have chosen the loose working point supported from the POG~\cite{WTagTWikiWPs}, where the studies related to this choice are documented in Sec.~\ref{app:tau21}. 

%A tighter working point was shown to reduce the expected sensitivity. 
The $\nsub$ spectra for the AK8 jet is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tau21}.
%The efficiency of the $\nsub$ selection is found to be uniform over the whole mass range of the signal, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_comp_tau21}.

%\caption{Double-b tagger discriminant for QCD background and different mass signals.}
%\label{fig:schema1}
%\end{figure}

In order to identify the AK8 jet most likely to contain two b quarks, we use the double \cPqb-tagger discriminant~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-15-002}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:doubleb}.

A brief description of the double b tagger is as follows: Tracks and secondary vertices associated to a jet is used, as for standard \cPqb-tagging. Tracks are used to calculate N-subjettiness axes of a jet. In the calculation of N-subjettiness, axes are defined for each prong which are used as input to the double-b tagger instead of the jet-direction. The two $\tau$-axis directions are used to resolve the two B-hadron decay chains we expect for a X to \bbbar signal. Secondary vertex observables are assigned to each axis independently of the subjet components. Then  b-tagging observables are computed using displaced  tracks, secondary vertex (SV) and two-SV system information. This dedicated tagger represents an alternative for boosted topologies to the subjet b-tag which relies on the subjet definition.

We have studied the Medium 1 and Medium 2 operating points corresponding to the double b discriminator $>$ 0.6 and 0.8 and signal efficiencies of 65\% and 30\%, respectively, as measured in the bulk graviton samples. The Medium 2 operating point was shown to give the best signal-background discrimination, as described in Sec.~\ref{app:doubleb}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Figures/shapedoubleb.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Double-b tagger discriminant for the AK8 jet.}
\label{fig:doubleb}
\end{figure} 

For the AK4 jets, we use the deep CSV tagger Medium working point to b-tag the jets, just as the resolved analysis does (HIG-17-009). The deep CSV tagger is a new tagger that performs better than the CSVv2 tagger and the CMVA tagger. The deep CSV tagger is similar to the CSVv2 tagger, but it uses up to six tracks in the training. Deep neural network training is used, where the nodes in the last layer use a normalized exponential function to interpret the output as a probability for a certain jet flavour class (exactly one b hadron, at least two b hadrons, exactly one c hadron, at least two c hadron, or none of the above), where each class is independent. We use the DeepCSV P(b) + P(bb) as our tagger, requiring this value be greater than 0.6324. The Medium working point corresponds to an efficiency of 68\%. Further documentation of the tagger can be found in (BTV-16-002). The DeepCSV P(b) + P(bb) for the two selected AK4 jets can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:AK4btag}.

\label{fig:AK4btag}
\end{figure} 


Lastly, we studied many variables related to unselected AK4 jets present in selected events to determine how to remove as much \ttbar as possible. These studies are documented in Sec.~\ref{app:AK4variables}. The variable that provided the most discriminating power was the invariant mass of the two AK4 selected AK4 jets combined with the AK4 jet closest to one of the selected AK4 jets, which we call the triAK4jet mass. This variable can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:triak4jetm}, where we place a cut requiring the value of the invariant mass to be larger than 200 GeV. For further documentation on the study of \ttbar and what events are passing full selection, see Sec.~\ref{app:ttbar}.

%We have then optimized the operating point to use for this search separately for low and high \pt jets based on the expected sensitivity. The optimal choice results to be Tight for low and medium \pt regime while Loose for high \pt jets. An optimization of the double b tagger categories were done using a full event selection and expected limits based on the data. The Alphabet method, with signal region blinded, was used to obtain the background estimate in the signal region. Among the possible combinations taken into account the best sensitivity is achieved when we combine the following two categories:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item TT, both H-jets pass the tight operating point.
%\item LL, both H-jets pass the loose operating point but both fail the tight operating point, i.e. not in the TT category. This also means that if one of the jets passes loose but failes tight, and the other passes the tight operating point, such an event is classified as LL.
%\end{itemize} 
The cut flow is given in Table~\ref{tab:sigeff} for bulk gravitons. %and in Table~\ref{tab:RadionCutFlowEff} for radions. The main difference in the efficiencies of the spin-2 and the spin-0 models stems from the different $\Delta\eta_{jj}$ distributions, that for the bulk graviton being more central. Thus the bulk gravitions have a higher efficiency than the radions.

A study on why so few full selection events pass the boosted selection at high mass is documented in Sec.~\ref{app:boostsel}.

\subsubsection{Invariant mass definition and ``reduced mass''\label{sss:DijetMassDef}}

The invariant \mjj mass distribution of the AK8 jet and two AK4 jets in the event corresponds to the invariant mass of the resonance searched for. As documented in the boosted case ~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026}, we use instead the reduced mass, defined
% However, it is well known that techniques such as kinematic fit that constraint the mass of each Higgs candidate to $\mH$ improves the resonance resolution and ultimately the sensitivity~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-008}. This technique was well validated also in the resolved case~\cite{Khachatryan:2015year}. For the boosted case, we considered constraining either the groomed or the ungroomed mass of the Higgs-tagged jets to \mH to improve the resolution of \mjj. A systematic study was performed in Ref.~\cite{CMS-AN-15-265}. In some cases we observed an improvement of the resolution but an over-correction of $\mjj$, \textit{i.e.}, the average position of $\mjj$ shifted well above $\mx$.
%It was found that the variable
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
\mjjs \equiv \mjj - (\mj^{AK8}-\mH) - (\mj^{1AK4 + 2AK4}-\mH)
\label{eq:Mjjs}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
since it provides resolution improvement and the mean position of \mjjs remains at $\approx \mx$, as can be seen in the study documented in Sec.~\ref{app:redm}. The reduced mass can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:redm}.

\subsection{Boosted and Resolved Selection Rejection\label{ss:boostres}}

This analysis is meant to bridge the gap between the fully resolved HH4b selection, aimed at lower mass resonances, and the fully boosted HH4b selection, by combining elements of both and adding some of its own. Below, the selection for these two analyses is documented, where rejecting events from either analysis means rejecting events that pass either of these selections. 

\subsubsection{Boosted Analysis\label{sss:boost}}

This analysis is documented in~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026}.

Selection is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Passes triggers described in Table~\ref{tab:trigpaths};
\item Two AK8 jets, $\pt > 300$ GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$, tight ID;
\item The soft drop mass of both AK8 jets is $105 < M_{\rm soft\,drop} < 135\GeV$, with all necessary jet mass corrections applied;
\item $|\Delta\eta| < 1.3$ between two AK8 jets;
\item $\tau_{21}$ $<$ 0.55 for both AK8 jets;
\item $M_{jj}$ $>$ 750 GeV;
\item Falls into one of the following categories: both AK8 jets have double-b $>$ 0.8, one AK8 jet has double-b $>$ 0.8 and the other has 0.3 $<$ double-b $<$ 0.8, both AK8 jets have 0.3 $<$ double-b $<$ 0.8.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Resolved Analysis\label{sss:resolve}}
This analysis is documented in\textcolor{red}{HIG-17-009}.

Selection is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Passes HLT\_QuadJet45\_TripleBTagCSV\_p087 and/or HLT\_DoubleJet90\_Double30\_TripleBTagCSV\_p087;
\item Four AK4 jets, $\pt > 30$ GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$;
\item All AK4 jets pass deep CSV medium tag;
\item Each dijet pair has $\Delta R$ $<$ 1.5;
\item The pair that minimizes $(\frac{MH1 - 120}{20})^{2} + (\frac{MH2 - 120}{20})^{2}$ is chosen, and the square root of this quantity must be $<$ 1;

%An example of the improvement is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:subtImp} for 1, 2 and 3 TeV resonance mass hypotheses. \mjjs will henceforth be referred to as \textit{reduced mass}.
