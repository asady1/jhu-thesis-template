\section{B-tagging Optimization\label{app:doubleb}}

The $\tau_{21}$ cut, triAK4jet cut, and double b cut were examined together to see which had the highest significance. It was found that double b $>$ 0.8, $\tau_{21} < 0.55$ and triAK4jet mass $>$ 200 GeV produce the highest significance, as seen in Tab.~\ref{tab:doubleb}. All MC is weighted by cross section multiplied by luminosity and divided by number of total events.

\caption{sig/sqrt(background) for bulk graviton signal and QCD + ttbar background, for full selection with a cut on double b of 0.6 or 0.8, a cut on puppi tau21 $<$ 0.55, and a cut on the invariant mass of the 2 AK4 jets and the nearest AK4 jet to them of $>$ 200. Note for mass 600, the mean and standard deviation were different for cuts including doubleb $>$ 0.6  and 0.8 histograms so a different mass window was used, while for 800 and up, the same mass window is used for cuts including 0.6 and 0.8.}\label{tab:doubleb}
