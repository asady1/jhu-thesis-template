\section{Conclusion\label{sec:Summary}}
The search for a new resonance decaying to two standard model Higgs bosons is conducted using CMS $\Pp\Pp$ collision data collected in 2016 at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intLumi. The $\Hbb$ decay, having the largest branching ratio, is used, given rise to a final state with four $\cPqb$ quarks. One of the Higgs bosons is Lorentz boosted and thus the decay products are merged into one large-area jet, while the other is resolved and the decay produts are two distinct jets. The main background is multijet production through QCD interactions, which is estimated from data and \ttbar MC. The results are interpreted in terms of narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extradimension models.
