\section{Deep CSV Optimization\label{app:deepCSV}}

The medium deep CSV working point was chosen because the resolved analysis chose this working point. In order to ensure that this was also the most optimal working point for our analysis, an a priori expected median significance test was performed, presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:dcsvopt}, which confirms that the medium working point does perform best.
