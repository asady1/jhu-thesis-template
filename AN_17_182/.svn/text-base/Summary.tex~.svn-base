\section{Conclusion\label{sec:Summary}}
The search for a new massive resonance decaying to two standard model Higgs bosons is conducted using CMS $\Pp\Pp$ collision data collected in 2016 at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \intLumi. The $\Hbb$ decay, having the largest branching ratio, is used, given rise to a final state with four $\cPqb$ quarks. However the Higgs bosons are highly Lorentz boosted and thus the decay products are merged into one large-area jet. The main background is multijet production through QCD interactions, which is estimated entirely from the data. The results are interpreted in terms of narrow radions and bulk gravitons in warped extradimension models.
