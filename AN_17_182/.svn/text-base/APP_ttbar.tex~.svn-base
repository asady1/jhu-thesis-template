\section{\ttbar Studies\label{app:ttbar}}

In order to understand more about \ttbar, a couple studies were performed. An analyis of a portion of the cutflow, shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:ttbarcut}, shows that the AK4 mass and btag cuts are removing a lot of QCD, but not as much \ttbar.

\caption{Comparison of number of events in different samples - preselection is 1 AK8 jet \pt $>$ 250, $|\eta| < 2.4$, softdrop corrected mass $>$ 40, 2 AK4 jets $>$ $\Delta R$ 0.8 away from fatjet, dCSV $>$ 0.2219, \pt $>$ 30, $|\eta| < 2.4$, with highest total btag and within $\Delta R$ 1.5 of each other, lepton veto, trigger}\label{tab:ttbarcut}
\end{table}

Below, the softdrop mass of \ttbar shows that most AK8 jets are often W's, and occasionaly a top, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:ttbarmass}, with the same preselection as the shape plots.
