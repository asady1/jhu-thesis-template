\section{Invariant Mass and Reduced Mass\label{app:redm}}
The boosted analysis used reduced mass similar to the one defined in~\ref{eq:Mjjs}, so a study was performed to evaluate whether it would be better to use invariant or reduced mass in this analysis. Fig.~\ref{fig:invmredm} shows invariant mass and reduced mass for several bulk graviton signals for the preselection outlined for shape plots as well as the full selection of the analysis, with all samples normalized to their integral.

Reduced mass has a narrower peak, as can be seen in the figure, and is shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:invmredm}.
