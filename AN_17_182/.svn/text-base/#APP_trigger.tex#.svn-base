\section{Trigger Studies\label{app:trigger}}

Several different trigger strategies were considered to maximize effectiveness of the analysis. In Tab.~\ref{tab:trigopt}, we compare the significance for different signal masses for just HT800, the Boosted OR triggers (the triggers used by the boosted analysis), and the BTag OR triggers (the triggers used by the resolved analysis:HLTQuadJet45TripleBTagCSVp087v, HLTDoubleJet90Double30TripleBTagCSVp087v). The HT800 trigger can't be used by itself because it's prescaled in some of the runs, and the Boosted OR performs best at mid-mass, where this analysis is most effective, so this trigger set was chosen.

It was noticed that the triggers never became fully efficient as a function of reduced mass. When examining the same trigger efficiency as a function of HT, in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigHTeff}, it does become fully efficient around ~1000 \GeV as expected. In order to account for this, it is best to bin trigger efficiency in $|AK8 eta - (AK4_1 + AK4_2) eta|$, or $\Delta\eta$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:trigdEta}, we can see that for $\Delta\eta > 1.3$ the trigger is not fully efficient as a function of reduced mass, but for $\Delta\eta < 1.3$, it is. Binning in $\Delta\eta$ was optimized, as documented in~\ref{app:deta}, for 0-1.0 and 1.0-2.0.

The trigger combination has a high efficiency at reduced mass below 700 GeV, dips down between 700 and 1000 GeV, and is then fully efficient afterwards. In order to better understand why we see this high efficiency at low reduced mass, each trigger in the set was examined separately, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:trigsep}.

All triggers but AK8PFJet360\_TrimMass30 and PFHT650\_WideJetMJJ900DEtaJJ1p5 show this phenomenon. Upon closer look at reduced mass for QCD with the preselection applied, with the preselection applied and PFJet260, and with the preselection applied + PFJet260 + Boosted OR (Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDredm}), we see that the difference between the latter two is almost nonexistent below 700 GeV. Comparing these to QCD with no trigger selection, we can see that PFJet260 isn't fully efficient.

\end{figure}

Lower \pt triggers were examined in place of PFJet260 and it was found that efficiency at low reduced mass goes down as \pt threshold goes down, which supports the hypothesis that the high efficiency at low mass is because of the efficiency of the PFJet260 trigger. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:lowPTtrig}. A lower threshold trigger was not chosen, however, because of prescales that come with lower threshold triggers, and because the analysis is not sensible below 700 GeV.

\end{figure}

We examined the realtionship between HT and reduced mass to better understand why we don't see high efficiency at low HT as we do with reduced mass. In Fig.~\ref{fig:2DHTredm}, we see that a large reason for this is that there are very few events with HT $<$ 700 GeV, which is expected because of the triggers that have been chosen. With few events in this region, we see low efficiency at low HT, whereas there are more events with reduced mass $<$ 700 GeV, so we are able to notice the high efficiency at low reduced mass due to the inefficiency of PFJet260.

Trigger efficiency was also examined as a function of b-tagging variables in data. It was found that, while the triggers are never fully efficient as a function of b-tagging, there is no dependency on b-tagging variables, Fig.~\ref{fig:btagEff}.

\label{fig:btagEff}
\end{figure}

To ensure that full efficiency is reached for b-tagging variables, we examined double b-tagger with the same trigger preselection but raising the reduced mass requirement to $>$ 1200 GeV. It was found that in both data (Runs B-H, B-F, and G-H) as well as MC, the OR of triggers was fully efficient, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:doubleb1200}.
