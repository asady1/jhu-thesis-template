\section{Background Estimation\label{sec:BkgEst}}

\subsection{Alphabet Background Estimate\label{ss:Alphabet}}
We measure the QCD background with a data-driven method which exploits a number of sidebands of the signal region. These sidebands are defined with respect to the AK8 jet based on its mass and the value of the double-b discriminator. Considering these two variables, we may define several regions, as outlined in Figure \ref{F:ABCDEFregions}: the \textit{pre-tag} region consists of all events which pass all selection requirements except the soft-drop mass requirements and tagger requirements on the AK8 jet. The \textit{signal} region is the subset of those events which pass the mass requirement and pass the tagger requirement we impose on our signal. The \textit{anti-tag} region is the subset of events which pass the mass requirement but fail the tagger requirement. All other events in the pre-tag region constitute the mass-sideband. For QCD background, we expect the shapes but not normalizations of distributions of events in the signal and anti-tag regions to be similar. If there were no correlation between the jet mass and the tagging variable, we could simply measure in the mass sideband the ratio of passing to failing events and scale the anti-tag region by this to obtain an estimate of the signal region (this method is often referred to as the ABCD method).

%As can be seen from Figure \ref{F:twotone2} the tagging variable we consider has a dependence on mass. Thus, 
As documented in ~\cite{CMS-PAS-B2G-16-026}, the tagging variable we consider has a dependence on mass.
Thus, to obtain the normalization, we must measure a \textit{conversion rate} or the pass-fail ratio, $R_{p/f}$ which depends on mass. We can fit for such a dependence in the mass-sidebands. The pass-fail ratio $R_{p/f}$ is obviously correlated with the double b tagger operating point used to define the passing criteria for the jets.

The background estimation is performed for the following cases: rejecting any events that pass the boosted selection, rejecting any events that pass the boosted or resolved selections, and only applying full selection with no rejection of boosted or resolved events.

The solid curve represents the profile distribution of a respective region while the dashed line is the profile of the other HT region. From this we can see that the double b-tagger has no dependence on the jet $\pt$, making it a stronger candidate for use in our estimate than the n-subjettiness.} \label{F:twotone2}

%\subsection{Results in Simulation\label{ss:BkgValInMC}}

%Figure \ref{F:closuresim} (left) shows a quadratic fit in the mass sidebands of the conversion rate $R_{p/f}$ to pass the requirement double-b$ > 0.6$, in QCD MC for the full selection. Note that the signal region and anti-tag regions are not included in the fit. The true value of the conversion rate in this mass window is also shown in the figure. This conversion rate is then applied (as a function of mass) to the anti-tag region to obtain an estimate of the signal region. The estimated and true background in signal region are shown in Figure \ref{F:closuresim} (right).Two systematic uncertainties arise naturally from this estimate. The dominant error is the uncertainty in the fit to the mass sideband regions. The uncertainty in the fit is shown as a dashed line enveloping the fit in Figure \ref{F:closuresim} (left). This error can be treated as fully correlated between all mass bins when setting limits. The second source of error comes from propagating the statistical uncertainty in the anti-tag region to the signal region. This error is uncorrelated between bins and is smaller than the fitting error. Both errors are shown in the figure.

\subsection{Closure Test in Data\label{ss:BkgValInData}}

We use the region where AK4 dijet mass $<$ 70\GeV for our closure test. We use a quadratic fit in the mass sidebands of the conversion rate $R_{p/f}$ to pass the requirement double-b$ > 0.8$, after first subtracting \ttbar MC from data. Note that the signal region and anti-tag regions are not included in the fit. The true value of the conversion rate in this mass window is also shown in the figure. This conversion rate is then applied (as a function of mass) to the anti-tag region to obtain an estimate of the signal region. The estimated and true background in signal region are shown on the left in Fig.~\ref{fig:closuredataboost} for a selection rejecting boosted events. Two systematic uncertainties arise naturally from this estimate. The dominant error is the uncertainty in the fit to the mass sideband regions. The uncertainty in the fit is shown as a dashed line enveloping the fit on the right in Fig.~\ref{fig:closuredataboost} for a selection rejecting boosted events. This error can be treated as fully correlated between all mass bins when setting limits. The second source of error comes from propagating the statistical uncertainty in the anti-tag region to the signal region. This error is uncorrelated between bins and is smaller than the fitting error. Both errors are shown in the figure.

%As a further test of closure, we test our method in data, estimating the QCD content of a region similar to the signal region except that the 2$^{nd}$ jet is constrained to fail the double-b requirement. Results are shown in Figure \ref{F:closuredata} in the same format as for the closure test in QCD, for three values of the cut on the double-b: 0.8 (tight), 0.6 (medium) and 0.3 (loose). Further checks of our method are shown in the Appendix~\ref{app:SigInjection}.

\subsection{Signal Regions Prediction\label{ss:BkgInSigRegion}}

%The sensitivity of the analysis with respect to the choice of double-b tagging working point was optimized using the limit expected from various scenarios. In the end, we choose to combine two regions: the first, which we call TT, requires that both Higgs candidates pass the tight double-b requirement: double-b$ > 0.8$, where the value $0.8$ was chosen to maximize sensitivity. At high di-jet masses, the background component is reduced, and a looser working point can be used. We define a second category, which we call LL, where we require both jets to pass the requirement double-b$ > 0.3$. We will eventually combine these two regions, with the events from TT are removed from LL to ensure that the two region are orthogonal. This will allow us to set the strongest limit possible on the full range of signal masses.
 
%The background prediction of the signal region (in data) is shown in Figure \ref{F:AlphabetSIGTT} for the TT region, and in Figure \ref{F:AlphabetS
%IGLL} for the LL region. The analysis remains blinded at this time. Please notice that the LL region is made orthogonal to the TT region. 

The blinded conversion rate $R_{p/f}$ and application of that fit to the anti-tag region to estimate the background in the signal region can be found in Fig.~\ref{fig:databoost} for a selection rejecting boosted events, in Fig.~\ref{fig:databoostres} for a selection rejecting boosted and resolved events, and in Fig.~\ref{fig:data} for a selection retaining both boosted and resolved events.

\subsubsection{Signal Models}\label{ss:SigBkgModels}


Signal shape is modelled with a sum of a crystal ball function and a Gaussian to describe the tails. CB and Gaussian functions are constrained to have the same mean value. The $\mjjs$ distributions for the signal are modelled using the sum of a Gaussian and a Crystal-Ball function.
