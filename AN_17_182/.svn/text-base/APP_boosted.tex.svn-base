\section{Boosted Selection Studies\label{app:boostsel}}

A series of studies were done to better understand why so few events that pass full selection for this analysis pass the boosted selection as well at high mass. The study was performed on the Bulk Graviton 2000 GeV mass point.

Examining the $\Delta R$ between the selected AK4 jets and the nearest unselected AK8 jet to each, in Fig.~\ref{fig:dRAK8AK4boost}, we see that the highest \pt selected AK4 jet matches to this AK8 jet, and the other selected AK4 jet is within the cone of the AK8 jet. This figure was made after full selection.

However, as we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaEtaboost}, many of the events in this analysis wouldn't pass the boosted selection's $\Delta \eta$ cut of $<$ 1.3. This figure was made after full selection and shows the $\Delta\eta$ for the two highest \pt AK8 jets in the event.

Additionally, when examining a 2D plot of the unselected AK8 jet mass and the AK4 dijet mass, where full selection minus the dijet mass cut was applied, we see that while most events fall within the dijet mass window, the unselected AK8 jet has a softdrop mass near 0. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:2Dboost}. Therefore these events would all fail the boosted analysis's mass requirement.

Lastly, as can be see in Fig.~\ref{fig:tau21boost}, some of the events would also have failed the boosted analysis's $\tau_{21}$ cut on the unselected AK8 jet, where we show the $\tau_{21}$ for the highest \pt unselected AK8 jet.
