\section{Overlap With Other Analyses\label{app:overlap}}
Overlap with the resolved resonant analysis as described in~\ref{sss:resolve}, calculated for the full semi-boosted selection after rejecting boosted events, is as follows in Tab.~\ref{tab:resoverlap}, where BG stands for bulk graviton and R stands for radion.
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Sample & Percent Overlap \\ \hline
BG 750 & 49\%\\
R 750 & 47\%\\
BG 800 & 44\%\\
R 800 & 43\%\\
BG 900 & 40\%\\
BG 1000 & 36\%\\
R 1000 & 36\%\\
BG 1200 & 28\%\\
R 1200 & 30\%\\
R 1400 & 20\%\\
BG 1600 & 7\%\\
R 1600 & 12\%\\
BG 2000 & 2\%\\
data & 11\%\\
