\section{N-subjettiness Optimization\label{app:tau21}}

The boosted analysis used the $\tau_{21}$ low working point, but we examined all three working points to optimize for this analysis. It was found that the low working point was better overall, when examining a priori expected mean significance using combine, as can be seen in Tab.~\ref{tab:tau21opt}.
